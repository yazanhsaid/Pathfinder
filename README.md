# Pathfinder

This program creates a 2-dimensional array within the Grid class and uses a BFS (breadth-first search) algorithm to traverse and find a way through the randomized obstacles within the grid. The size of the grid is scalable and the number of obstacles are created with a 30% probability per grid element. This small project showcases my knowledge of creating and using 2D arrays, data structures such as queues, and traversal algorithms within a 2D array utilizing the powerful BFS algorithm.
